# CINEMAAI STUDIO: AI Feature Integration Roadmap

This document outlines the powerful AI capabilities available for integration into the CinemaAI Studio to build a world-class, intelligence-driven creative suite.

## 🎨 Visual Generation & Editing
| Feature | Capability | Integration in CinemaAI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nano Banana Pro** | High-quality image generation from text prompts. | Power the **Concept Art** and **Moodboard** nodes. |
| **Veo 3** | Animate images or create video ads from product photos. | Main engine for the **VeoI2VNode** and cinematic sequence generation. |
| **Image Edit Auto** | Nano Banana powered object addition/removal & background swap. | Integrated in **Wardrobe** and **Lighting** nodes for scene touch-ups. |
| **Aspect Ratio Control** | Precise shape control (vertical for social, horizontal for cinema). | Feature for the **CanvasRatioNode** to ensure multi-platform export. |

## 🎙️ Audio & Conversational Intelligence
| Feature | Capability | Integration in CinemaAI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gemini Live API** | Conversational voice experiences and "Live" interaction. | **AI Director Voice Assistant** - Talk back to the studio for hands-free creative control. |
| **Speech-to-Text** | Live, real-time transcription of audio feeds. | Real-time **Dialogue Capturing** during actor recording or video review. |
| **Audio Spark** | High-quality text-to-speech generation. | Power the **DialogueNode** for instant voiceovers and character lines. |
| **Audio Spark (v2)** | Transcribe and generate conversational apps. | Power **SFX** and **Music** prompt generation based on scene context. |

## 🧠 Intelligence & Agents
| Feature | Capability | Integration in CinemaAI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gemini Flash-Lite** | Lightning-fast, real-time responses. | **Instant Auto-complete** for prompt builders and UI interactions. |
| **Thinking Mode** | "Pause to think" for complex structural queries. | Power the **AutoStoryboard** logic for high-level script analysis and structural planning. |
| **Video Library** | Deep understanding and summarization of long videos. | **Asset Management** - Automatically tag and summarize uploaded B-roll or footage. |
| **Document Scanner** | Extract data from receipts, menus, and charts. | **Production Management** - Scan physical script pages or gear lists into the workspace. |

## 🌐 Knowledge & Real-time Data
| Feature | Capability | Integration in CinemaAI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Google Search** | Real-time data integration and fact-checking. | **Research Agent** - Find real-world locations, period-accurate costume references, or news. |
| **Google Maps** | Real-time place and route data. | **Location Scout** - Find and visualize real filming locations directly in the studio. |

## 🚀 Strategy for "Number 1 Web App in the World"

### 1. The "Thinker-Doer" Architecture
Use **Thinking Mode** for the high-level script writing and storyboard planning, and **Flash-Lite** for the instant UI feedback (the "HUD"). This makes the studio feel both intelligent and incredibly snappy.

### 2. Multi-Modal Consistency
Combine **Nano Banana Pro** with **Veo 3** to create "Reference-Bound" generation. An image generated in the concept phase should serve as the anchor for the video generation to ensure the character doesn't change between shots.

### 3. Voice-First Directing
Implement **Gemini Live** as a "Director's Assistant." Instead of clicking nodes, the user should be able to say, *"Hey Gemini, add a dramatic low-angle shot with neon lighting to the second scene,"* and have the UI react in real-time.

### 4. Real-World Grounding
Use the **Google Search & Maps** integration to allow creators to ground their fictional worlds in reality. Finding a "desert location at sunset" should pull real coordinate lighting data to influence the AI's lighting model.
